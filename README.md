<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


This project demonstrates the application of **Vision Transformer (ViT)** and **CLIP** models for fashion product image classification. Our model utilizes a combination of image and text embeddings to predict product categories, making it well-suited for e-commerce and fashion recommendation engines.

Key features include:
- Robust image and text embedding with ViT and CLIP.
- Easy-to-follow implementation, allowing for customization and further development.
- Supports batch processing and CUDA acceleration.
